## Wireframe Portfolio Example

### Synopsis
***

This is an example of a wireframe portfolio site using HTML/CSS. This was a test of my basic design skills as a front-end web designer. You will be advocating for your most important client—yourself! By making a portfolio, you'll take your first step toward building your web development brand.

The portfolio site consists of 3 html documents, two css files (including the Meyerweb reset.css), and images.

### Folder Structure
